This document is meant to help developers get an initial rendering pipeline set up in order to create your own custom rendering pipeline in Bevy while still using the built in render graph.

This document doesn't try to go into the specifics of WGPU. Instead, I'll be following the excellent WGPU introduction available [here](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) and treating this more of a companion document that can help people migrate the tutorial into Bevy.
